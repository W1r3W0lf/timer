For this project I am trying a bunch of new things.

I'm going to be working with GTK+
And I'm going to try my hand at fixing build portability.


Fixing Build portability.

I want to have a way that everyone can build this project the same way.
One way I have seen to do this in the wild is to have a build envernment in docker, podman, or vagrent.
These solutions work. But I think that they introduce more complexity then is needed.

Python has some solutions for this already being Venv and Conda.

These tools are grate. No need to spin up a VM that you have to install all of your tools in.
You can work with your program on your system with everything that it needs.

The Venv/Conda modle is what I want. Guix seems to allow this type of modle for non-python enviernments.

This project will be buildable without the Guix package mannager.
It is that using the Guix package mannager should make it equivalent to getting a python project off the ground with pip and venv.
As opposed to trying to compile a C++ program with CMake and looking at the errors for what packages you need to install. 

Another solutions seems to be Build2 for C/C++. But that restricts the projcect to C/C++ and it dosen't have as many packages as Guix does.
